#HAD7 Q1:Write a program that computes and prints the result of 512 − 282/47 · 48 + 5. (It is roughly .1017)

a=512
b=282
c=47
d=48
e=5
f=(a-b)/(c*(d+e))
print(f)

#HAD7 Q2:write a program that ask the user to enter the number. print out the square but use the optional argument to print it out in a full sentence
import math
n =int(input("enter a number : "))
print("the square of"+" "+str(n)+":"+str(n**2))

#HAD7 Q3:write a program that ask the user to enter a number x and then use the sep optional argument to print out 2x 3x 4x each should be seprated with 3 dashes
import math
x=int(input("enter a number : "))
print(str(x)+"---"+str(2*x)+"---"+str(3*x)+"---"+str(4*x)+"---"+str(5*x))

#HAD7 Q4: Write a program that asks the user for a weight in kilograms and converts it to pounds. There are 2.2 pounds in a kilogram.
import math
x=int(input("enter a weight in kilogram : "))
print("weight in pounds"+str(x*2.2))

#HAD7 Q5:Write a program that asks the user to enter three numbers (use three separate input statements). Create variables called total
## and average that hold the sum and average of the three numbers and print out the values of total and average
import math
x=int(input("enter first number : "))
y=int(input("enter second number : "))
z=int(input("enter third number : "))
sum=x+y+z
average=sum/3
print("sum"+str(sum))
print("average"+str(average))

#HAD7 Q6:A lot of cell phones have tip calculators. Write one. Ask the user for the price of the meal and the percent tip they want to leave.
